12. Process states in XV6:
    Runnable: Processes that are ready to execute but waiting for the CPU.
    Running: The currently executing process.
    Sleeping: Processes waiting for an event (like I/O) to occur.
    Zombie: Processes that have finished execution but still have an entry in the process table.
13. File System Structure in XV6 is hierarchical similar to Unix.XV6's file system structure consists of 
    - inodes (store file metadata)
    - blocks (store file content)
    - directories (maps names to inodes) 
14. System Calls vs. Library Functions:
    System calls - Requests to the operating system for services like file manipulation, process control, etc. 
                   Examples in XV6 include fork(), exit().
    Library functions - Built-in functions that applications can use, often wrapping system calls for ease of use.
                        Examples include printf() or fopen().
15. Memory Paging in XV6:
    Paging in XV6 involves dividing memory into fixed-size pages, allowing non-contiguous allocation. 
    It ensures efficient memory usage by loading only necessary pages into memory which leads to the reduction of external storage access time.
16. Essential Shell Commands in XV6:
    ls - Lists directory contents.
    cd - Changes the current directory.
    mkdir - Creates a new directory.
17. Process Synchronization in XV6:
    Process synchronization ensures orderly execution and shared resource access among concurrent processes. 
    Techniques like locks, semaphores, or atomic operations are used to prevent race conditions and maintain data consistency.
18. Interrupt Handling in XV6:
    Interrupts in XV6 are managed through interrupt handlers. 
    They allow the system to respond to asynchronous events such as I/O completion or hardware signals. 
    Interrupt Service Routines handle these interrupts to perform necessary actions.
19. Virtual Memory in XV6:
    Virtual memory provides processes with an illusion of a larger memory space than physically available. 
    XV6 uses paging to implement virtual memory, offering benefits like efficient memory utilization and protection from unauthorized access.
20. Boot Process in XV6:
    The boot process involves loading the bootloader (e.g., the Multiboot-compliant bootloader) into memory, which then loads the XV6 kernel. 
    The kernel initializes hardware, sets up memory management, and launches the first user-level process.
